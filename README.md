## Dependencies

You'll need to install `python3`, `pip`, `virtualenv`, and `django`.

## Virtual Environment

We avoid system problems and dependency issues by running our project in virtual environments. It's recommended to have the environment activated when testing.

**On Mac / Linux:**

```bash
# Activating
source env/linux/bin/activate
# when activated, you'll see (env) before your command line

# Deactivating
deactivate
```

**On Windows:**

```
# Activating
env\Windows\Scripts\activate
# when activated, you'll see (env) before your command line

# Deactivating
env\Windows\Scripts\deactivate

```

## Running test server:

```bash
cd app/helps_booking_system/
python3 manage.py runserver
```
